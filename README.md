# Addition Rules!

In this React application, the user is given an addition problem with two numbers ranging from 0 to 100. There is a controlled input for the user to enter their answer. The user should click the primary "Check Answer" button to submit their answer and get feedback of whether or not it was correct as calculated by the MathJS API. After submission, the "Check Answer" button turns grey to indicate it is disabled until the user clicks the "next question" button which will load two new random numbers. The "Check Answer" button then returns to it's original green color.
